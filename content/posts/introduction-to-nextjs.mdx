# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build
server-side rendered applications with ease. It provides a great developer
experience and enhances performance, making it a popular choice for building
modern web applications .

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source framework built on top of React, created by Vercel. It
allows developers to create single-page applications (SPAs) and multi-page
applications (MPAs) with server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. Next.js
provides a file-based routing system, automatic code splitting, and optimized
performance, making it a popular choice among developers looking to enhance
their React applications.

## Why Use Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages that make it an attractive choice for
developers:

1. **Performance**: With features like SSR and SSG, Next.js applications often
   load faster and perform better than traditional SPAs.
2. **SEO-Friendly**: Server-side rendering helps search engines crawl and index
   your site more effectively, leading to better visibility.
3. **Developer Experience**: Next.js provides a robust development environment
   with features like hot reloading, which enhances productivity.
4. **Flexibility**: Whether you're building a simple static site or a complex
   web application, Next.js can accommodate various use cases.
5. **Rich Ecosystem**: Being built on React, Next.js benefits from a vast
   ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it easy to integrate with other
   technologies.

## Key Features

### 1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

Next.js allows you to render pages on the server, improving SEO and loading
times.

### 2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**

You can pre-render pages at build time, which is ideal for content that doesn't
change often.

### 3. **API Routes**

Next.js supports API routes, allowing you to create backend endpoints within
your application.

### 4. **File-Based Routing**

With Next.js, you can create routes by simply adding files to the `pages`
directory.

### 5. **Automatic Code Splitting**

Next.js automatically splits your code, ensuring faster page loads by only
sending the necessary JavaScript for each page.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js application, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
