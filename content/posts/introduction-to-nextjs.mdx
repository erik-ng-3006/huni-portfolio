## Getting Started with Next.js

Getting started with Next.js is incredibly easy. Let's look at how you can
create your first Next.js app.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

If you prefer using Yarn, you can use these commands instead:

```bash
yarn create next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
yarn dev
```

After running these commands, you'll have a new Next.js project up and running
on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Why Choose Next.js?

1. **Performance**: Next.js optimizes your application for speed and efficiency.
2. **Developer Experience**: With features like Fast Refresh, development is a
   breeze.
3. **Scalability**: From small projects to large applications, Next.js scales
   with your needs.
4. **SEO-friendly**: Server-side rendering improves your site's search engine
   visibility.

## Conclusion

Next.js is more than just a framework; it's a game-changer for React
development. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web application,
Next.js provides the tools and optimizations you need to succeed.
