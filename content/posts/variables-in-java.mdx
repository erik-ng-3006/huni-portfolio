# Types of Variables in Java

## 1. Primitive Data Types

These are the basic types of data built into the language:

- **int**: Integer (e.g., `int age = 30;`)
- **double**: Double-precision floating-point (e.g., `double price = 19.99;`)
- **float**: Single-precision floating-point (e.g.,
  `float temperature = 36.6f;`)
- **char**: Character (e.g., `char grade = 'A';`)
- **boolean**: True or false (e.g., `boolean isActive = true;`)
- **byte**: 8-bit integer (e.g., `byte b = 100;`)
- **short**: 16-bit integer (e.g., `short s = 1000;`)
- **long**: 64-bit integer (e.g., `long l = 100000L;`)

## 2. Reference Data Types

These refer to objects and can be any instance of a class:

- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters (e.g.,
  `String name = "John";`)
- **Arrays**: A collection of similar types (e.g., `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};`)
- **Classes**: Custom data types defined by the user (e.g.,
  `MyClass obj = new MyClass();`)
- **Interfaces**: A reference type in Java that can contain only constants,
  method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

## 3. Variable Scope Types

Variables can also be categorized based on their scope:

- **Local Variables**: Declared within a method or block and can only be
  accessed within that method/block.
- **Instance Variables**: Declared inside a class but outside any method and are
  tied to an instance of the class.
- **Static Variables**: Declared with the `static` keyword and belong to the
  class rather than any instance.

## Summary

Java variables can be classified into primitive and reference types, with
further categorization based on their scope. Understanding these types is
essential for effective programming in Java.
