# Understanding Linked Lists in Java

## Introduction

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science to store
a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous
memory allocation, making them more flexible in terms of memory usage. This blog
post will explore the concept of linked lists in Java, their advantages,
disadvantages, and how to implement them.

## What is a Linked List?

A linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains two components:

1. **Data**: The value stored in the node.
2. **Pointer/Reference**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

The first node is called the **head**, and the last node points to `null`,
indicating the end of the list.

## Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node, allowing traversal
   in one direction.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains two pointers, one pointing to the
   next node and another to the previous node, allowing traversal in both
   directions.
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the head, forming a
   circle.

## Advantages of Linked Lists

- **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can grow and shrink in size as needed, unlike
  arrays which have a fixed size.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing nodes is more efficient
  than in an array, especially when working with large datasets.

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

- **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires additional memory for the
  pointer/reference.
- **Access Time**: Linked lists do not allow random access; accessing an element
  requires traversing from the head.

## Implementing a Singly Linked List in Java

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of a singly linked list in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    Node head;

    // Method to insert a new node at the end
    public void insert(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Method to display the linked list
    public void display() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.data + " -> ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        System.out.println("null");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
        list.insert(10);
        list.insert(20);
        list.insert(30);
        list.display(); // Output: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Linked lists are a powerful data structure that provides flexibility in managing
collections of data. While they have their pros and cons, understanding how to
implement and utilize linked lists can greatly enhance your programming skills
and efficiency in Java. Whether you are building complex data structures or
simply need a dynamic list, linked lists are worth considering.
