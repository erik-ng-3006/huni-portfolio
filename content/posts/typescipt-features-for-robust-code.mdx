# 5 TypeScript Features That Will Make Your Code More Robust

TypeScript continues to be a game-changer for developers seeking more reliable and maintainable code. In this post, we'll explore five powerful features that can significantly improve your code's robustness and type safety.

## 1. Discriminated Unions: Precise Type Narrowing

Discriminated unions allow you to create more precise type checks and safer code patterns:

```typescript
type Result =
	| { type: 'success'; data: string }
	| { type: 'error'; message: string };

function handleResult(result: Result) {
	switch (result.type) {
		case 'success':
			// TypeScript knows `data` is available
			console.log(result.data.toUpperCase());
			break;
		case 'error':
			// TypeScript knows `message` is available
			console.error(result.message);
			break;
	}
}
```

<Callout type='info'>
	Pro Tip: Discriminated unions provide compile-time safety by ensuring
	exhaustive type checking and preventing runtime errors.
</Callout>

## 2. Conditional Types: Dynamic Type Manipulation

Conditional types enable incredibly flexible type transformations:

```typescript
type NonNullable = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;

type Example = NonNullable;
// Results in type 'string'

type ExtractArray = T extends any[] ? T[number] : T;

type NumberArray = ExtractArray; // type is 'number'
type SingleNumber = ExtractArray; // type remains 'number'
```

<Callout type='warning'>
	Advanced Technique: Conditional types allow you to create powerful
	type-level utilities that can dramatically reduce type-related boilerplate.
</Callout>

## 3. Mapped Types: Transform Existing Types

Mapped types let you create new types by transforming existing ones:

```typescript
interface Product {
	name: string;
	price: number;
	description: string;
}

// Make all properties optional
type PartialProduct = {
	[P in keyof Product]?: Product[P];
};

// Make all properties readonly
type ReadonlyProduct = {
	readonly [P in keyof Product]: Product[P];
};
```

<Callout type='success'>
	Design Pattern: Mapped types are crucial for creating flexible type
	transformations without duplicating type definitions.
</Callout>

## 4. Branded Types: Prevent Accidental Type Misuse

Create type-safe primitives that prevent incorrect type assignments:

```typescript
type Brand = K & { __brand: T };

type USD = Brand;
type EUR = Brand;

function convertUSD(amount: USD) {
	return amount;
}

const dollars = 100 as USD;
const euros = 100 as EUR;

// Compile-time error: Cannot pass euros where USD is expected
convertUSD(euros);
```

<Callout type='danger'>
	Type Safety: Branded types provide an extra layer of type checking to
	prevent logical errors in your code.
</Callout>

## 5. Const Assertions: Literal Type Precision

Use const assertions to create more precise type definitions:

```typescript
const colors = {
	primary: '#007bff',
	secondary: '#6c757d',
	success: '#28a745',
} as const;

// Exact literal types, not just 'string'
type Color = (typeof colors)[keyof typeof colors];

function setColor(color: Color) {
	// Strictly typed color assignment
}

// Only these exact colors are allowed
setColor(colors.primary);
```

<Callout type='info'>
	Precision Matters: Const assertions lock down types to their exact literal
	values, providing unprecedented type precision.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

TypeScript's advanced type system offers powerful tools to write more robust, self-documenting code. By leveraging these features, you can catch errors earlier, reduce runtime bugs, and create more maintainable applications.

Remember, type safety is a journey. Start small, experiment, and gradually incorporate these techniques into your workflow.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
