# The Four Pillars of OOP in Java: A Comprehensive Guide

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that forms the
backbone of Java. At its core, OOP in Java is built upon four fundamental
principles, often referred to as the "four pillars." In this comprehensive
guide, we'll explore each of these pillars - encapsulation, inheritance,
polymorphism, and abstraction - with practical Java examples.

## 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data
within a single unit or object. It restricts direct access to some of an
object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and
misuse of the methods and data.

### Example:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;  // private field

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `balance` field is private, and can only be accessed or
modified through the public methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and
`getBalance()`. This ensures that the balance can't be modified directly,
maintaining the integrity of the account data.

## 2. Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing
class. The new class inherits fields and methods from the existing class,
promoting code reuse and establishing a relationship between the parent class
and the child class.

### Example:

```java
public class Animal {
    protected String name;

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }
}
```

Here, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`. It inherits the `name` field and `eat()`
method from `Animal`, and adds its own `bark()` method.

## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a
common super class. It can take the form of method overloading (compile-time
polymorphism) or method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

### Example:

```java
public class Shape {
    public double getArea() {
        return 0;
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```

In this example, both `Circle` and `Rectangle` override the `getArea()` method
from the `Shape` class. We can use polymorphism like this:

```java
Shape shape1 = new Circle(5);
Shape shape2 = new Rectangle(4, 5);

System.out.println(shape1.getArea());  // Calls Circle's getArea()
System.out.println(shape2.getArea());  // Calls Rectangle's getArea()
```

## 4. Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only
the functionality to the user. It can be achieved with abstract classes and
interfaces.

### Example using an abstract class:

```java
public abstract class Vehicle {
    protected String model;

    public Vehicle(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public abstract void move();
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String model) {
        super(model);
    }

    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println(model + " is driving on the road.");
    }
}

public class Boat extends Vehicle {
    public Boat(String model) {
        super(model);
    }

    @Override
    public void move() {
        System.out.println(model + " is sailing on the water.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Vehicle` is an abstract class that defines a common structure
for all vehicles but leaves the implementation of the `move()` method to its
subclasses.

### Example using an interface:

```java
public interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

public class Square implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}
```

Here, the `Drawable` interface defines a contract that all implementing classes
must fulfill, providing a high level of abstraction.

## Test Your Knowledge

understanding with a quick quiz!

    {
      question: 'In Java, which keyword is used to inherit from a class?',
      options: ['implements', 'extends', 'inherits', 'super'],
      correctAnswer: 1
    },
    {
      question:
        'Which OOP principle allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass?',

## Conclusion

Understanding and effectively utilizing these four pillars of OOP -
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction - is crucial for
writing robust, maintainable, and efficient Java code. Each principle
contributes to creating a well-structured object-oriented design, allowing for
code reuse, flexibility, and easier management of complex systems.

As you continue your journey in Java programming, keep these principles in mind.
Practice implementing them in your projects, and you'll soon find yourself
writing more elegant and powerful Java applications.
